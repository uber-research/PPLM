"The relationship between the human body and its environment is complex and interdependent. The environmental factors influencing metabolism, such as oxygenation, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), temperature, humidity, and temperature gradients, affect the metabolism of nutrients and proteins in the body. The effects of these environmental factors are mediated through the interaction of the cells with the cellular environment (i.e., metabolism, cell cycle","The relationship between the number of people in a country and its GDP is well known to anyone who has ever taken an economics class.

"Emphasised are the words ""emphasised"" and ""not exaggerated"". 
 
 I am not a scientist, but this is what my understanding of science is. The idea that there could be life on other planets in our solar system has been around for quite some time. It was first proposed by Carl Sagan back in 1979. He said it would take about 100 years to find out if we were alone or not.","Emphasised are the effects of exposure to the chemical compounds that are used to make plastic in a variety of ways: plastic bags, plastic bottles and polycarbonate containers (PCBs).

The chemical pollutants in these products can also affect human health, such as cancer, reproductive problems, birth defects, and the effects of exposure.

It is also estimated that the plastic chemicals in",Both,3,4,,Both,3,4,,Both,3,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,14_849_744
"Foundational to this is the idea that the human brain is a highly evolved and sophisticated machine. As you learn how to use this machine to make sense of and manipulate data, you become smarter, and more efficient in your daily operations of your machine. The ability to think about and solve problems and data science problems becomes easier for all of us with data science tools. Data science tools are becoming increasingly","Foundational to this is the idea that there are two types of people in our society. The first type have a strong belief in God and believe he created everything we see around us. They also tend to be more religious than those who do not believe.

 I think this is what makes Reddit so great. It has an amazing community with many different types of people. There are those who just want to talk about their favorite topics or have fun in general. Then there are those like me who enjoy reading stories","The key aspect discussed in this article is that the two main sources – one from the scientific community and one from the media – are not always mutually consistent.

"In this essay I will explain why the universe is expanding and how it came to be that way. 
 
 The Universe has always existed in a state of constant expansion. This expansion was caused by an event called inflation. It happened when all matter became so dense as to become undetectable from our vantage point. We can see light because we are able to detect gravitational waves which travel at nearly the speed of","In this essay, you will learn about what is meant by the ""social justice"" term ""justice"" and how it can be defined in a number of different ways: from a scientific perspective, from a moral, and from a social perspective.

 I am one of the latter group. I'm also very skeptical about religion as well. But what do you guys think? Is there any way we can get rid of this guy without having him be president? Or should he just stay","Views on the issue are mixed. The American Medical Association recently concluded that the practice of circumcision has no medical benefits and that it is unethical, and a recent study suggests some medical experts disagree.

But in an article posted online, scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, show the scientific evidence is inconclusive, at best, and that circumcision has health benefits for children.

"In summary:

The main goal of this paper is to examine whether a specific form of self-regulation, the self–regulation of emotion (or emotion‐driven behavior), can explain a wide range of observed and hypothesized effects of social and psychological data on intelligence, including those that are observed in the scientific literature and are associated with intelligence (e.g., research studies of the brain,","In summary , the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate . The expansion of space and time are two different things that can be measured independently by measuring how fast something moves in a straight line ( i.e. speed ) or how far away it appears to move from you ( distance ).

"It has been shown that in the human retina the photoreceptor cells of the retinal ganglion cells (RGC), which are involved in visual perception, are sensitive to light, which in turn leads to visual acuity, which is important for the function of the visual system. However, it was not until the advent of cell-based photoreceptors which are made in vivo","It has been shown that the brain is able to process information in a way similar to how it processes visual information. 
 
 This means that we can use our brains as computers and have them do things like play games or read books on paper.
