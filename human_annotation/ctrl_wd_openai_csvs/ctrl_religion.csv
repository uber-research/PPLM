"The relationship of the two countries is based on the concept of ""one country, two systems"" which implies a common history, culture and people.

 I was raised in a very religious family. My parents were both pastors and my grandparents are still active members of their church. They have always been extremely devout Christians who believe that God has spoken to them through various mediums over the years. This includes speaking directly into their children's ears when they ask questions about religion. When we moved out on",Both,4,5,,Both,4,4,,B,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,16_882_839
"Emphasised are the words ""God"" and ""God"". 
 
 &gt;The Bible is a book of stories about God that were written by men who believed in God. It contains many stories, but it also has some very important messages for people today. These include God's love for us, His plan to save us from our sins, and how we can be forgiven if we turn away from sin. 
 
","Emphasised are the words of Jesus Christ. They were written in the New Testament. They are not the same words spoken by the Apostle Paul (Romans 4:23-25).

It is Jesus Christ who, after being crucified, was raised and glorified by God, who is ""The God and Jesus Christ"" (1 Corinthians 10:13).

"Foundational to this is the idea that God created everything in six days and then rested on Sunday. 
 
 &gt;The Bible says that Jesus was born of a virgin, but it also tells us he had been conceived by God. This means that if you believe in God, you have to accept that He could create something from nothing. If you don't believe that, how can you be sure there isn't","Foundational to this is a belief in the ability of a person to change his/her character over time, through learning, self-reflection and a sense of God's love and favor toward the believer (see the article on the Christian God).

"The central theme of this book is that there is something fundamentally wrong in human beings: the lack of love. It's an argument for what the word is, and why people are so stupid. The problem is, the love they have doesn't work, and God is angry at them for their lack of love and the fact that they haven't been born again. God wants you to love God","The central theme of the Bible is that God loves us and wants to be with us. He has given his Son as a sacrifice for our sins. We are forgiven by Jesus Christ because he died on the cross so we can live forever in heaven. 
 
 But what about those who don't believe in God? What if they never heard or read anything about Jesus? How would you feel knowing your loved ones",Both,3,4,,Both,4,5,,Both,3,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,9_50_869
"The key aspect of the story is that Jesus was a man who had been raised up from death and died for our sins. He rose again to life after his resurrection in order to save us all. 
 
 This means he could not have done it alone. God needed him as well. If we are going to believe this story, then why did god need jesus? Why didn't he just resurrect him? It seems","The key aspect discussed in this paper is to define the term ""social capital"" (i.e., the social and cultural capital which supports the growth of the state and which is required to create a democratic and just society).

"In this essay I will try to explain why the Bible is a good book for Christians and how it can be used as an aid in understanding other religions. 
 
 &gt;The first thing that strikes me about the Old Testament is its beauty. It has been called “the most beautiful of all books.” This may sound like hyperbole, but it’s not. It’s not just beautiful, it’s also very easy","In this essay, I describe the historical context of the creation of the Church and the origins of Catholicism (or, more accurately, the Church).

I have heard it discussed by a few people, but I don't know what it is, and have only heard a few people talk about it before.

My point is","This essay discusses the relationship between religion and science. 
 
 &gt;The scientific method is a way of thinking about how we can understand our world in order to make it more predictable. It has been used for centuries by scientists as an instrument that allows them to test their theories against reality. In this essay, I will discuss some of the ways science uses religion.

"It has been shown that the Bible is not a reliable source of historical information. 
 
 &gt;The Book of Mormon was written by Joseph Smith in 1830 and published posthumously in 1830. This book contains many errors about ancient American history as well as modern history. For example, it claims that there were no Native Americans before Europeans arrived on the continent. In fact, they had lived for thousands of years prior","It has been shown that in order to prevent an individual or group from using their voice to oppress another religion they can't use their voice to criticize God in Scripture. The Bible itself teaches that you should not speak God's Name except in Scripture. It also states that if you want to speak God's Name God must tell you in Scripture that God has commanded you in His Word. You cannot tell God in your own language

 I am not trying to be snarky or anything, but it seems like there are many people who have no idea that atheists exist.

"Views on the nature of God and Jesus Christ are very different in my opinion. 
 
 I believe that there is a God, but not necessarily one who created everything or even cares about our existence. He has no interest in us at all. If he did, then why would he allow evil to exist? Why does he let people suffer? What purpose do we serve if he's so indifferent towards us?
